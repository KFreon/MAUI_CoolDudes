# Flooter but MAUI  
Implementing the same silly example used in my [Flutter exploration](https://github.com/KFreon/flutter_demo).  
This is also terrible code, I should have used [much better code](https://github.com/KFreon/MAUIExampleWithEFCore), but I was lazy.  

The main goal here was to feel what it was like to implement the same thing in both frameworks.  
I'd say MAUI felt better to write (read: more inline with paradigms I like), but the dev experience is just bad (hot reload especially).
